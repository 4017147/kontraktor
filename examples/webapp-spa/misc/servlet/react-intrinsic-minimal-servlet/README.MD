# React Servlet

A bridge of contractor to the servlet API.
Uses built in java implemented script bundling and es6 import transpilation.

[Detail documentation](https://github.com/RuedigerMoeller/kontraktor/wiki/Kontraktor-4-React-JSX)

Basics work, it should also be possible to bring full jnpm autoimport to a servlet. 
Peek me if you are interested in that.
