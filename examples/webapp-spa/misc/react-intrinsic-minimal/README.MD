# Minimal example on how to run react with kontraktor (without node/babel)

Deprecated. It's recommended to use (j)npm-based bundling as implemented since 4.11.

Uses a java implemented jsx compiler. But uses babel for transpilation (runs a demon).

* build or add to ide using mvn pom.xml
* run ReactMiniApp with working Dir [..]/react-intrinsic-minimal
* goto localhost:8080
