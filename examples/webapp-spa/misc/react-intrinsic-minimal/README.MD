# Minimal example on how to run react with kontraktor (without node/babel)

Deprecated. It's recommended to use (j)npm-based bundling as implemented since 4.11.

* Uses a java implemented jsx compiler.
* Showcases how to connect import with non-npm simple client side script-tags
(no session timeout handling, no session resurrection, no auto jnpm install [see react-material-ui example])

**how to run**
* build or add to ide using mvn pom.xml
* run ReactMiniApp with working Dir [..]/react-intrinsic-minimal
* goto localhost:8080
